## Description
The Particle Simulator is an interactive application that simulates the behavior of particles in a 2D space. Users can add particles, adjust gravity, and control the simulation speed using an intuitive toolbox. The simulator provides a visual representation of basic physics concepts such as gravity, collision detection, and particle interactions. It serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental physics and dynamics in a fun and engaging way.

## Features
- **Realistic Particle Dynamics:** 
  - Simulates the behavior of particles with properties like gravity, velocity, and collision detection, allowing for realistic interactions between particles.

- **Customizable Gravity:** 
  - Users can adjust the gravitational force affecting the particles in real-time through a user-friendly interface, enabling them to see how changes in gravity affect motion.

- **Dynamic Particle Creation:** 
  - Add new particles dynamically during simulation. Each particle can have unique properties such as size and velocity, offering endless experimentation possibilities.

- **Time Scale Control:** 
  - Modify the speed of the simulation using a time scale slider. This feature allows users to observe particle behaviors in slow motion or fast-forward, providing insights into their movements.

- **Interactive Toolbox:** 
  - The toolbox provides various controls, including buttons for adding particles, sliders for adjusting gravity, and numerical inputs for precise control. This makes the simulator accessible and easy to use.

- **Double Buffering for Smooth Rendering:** 
  - Implements double buffering to eliminate flickering during rendering, ensuring a smooth visual experience while interacting with the simulation.

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Introduction of different particle shapes, such as cubes.
  - Implementation of water physics for more complex interactions.
  - A menu screen for initializing the simulation with user-defined settings.
  - Addition of wind physics to influence particle motion.
  - Exploration of advanced physics concepts like torque and moment.
