# Pojgsa Particle Simulator

![Particle Simulator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-green)

## Description
The Particle Simulator is an interactive application that simulates the behavior of particles in a 2D space. Users can add particles, adjust gravity, and control the simulation speed using an intuitive toolbox. The simulator provides a visual representation of basic physics concepts such as gravity, collision detection, and particle interactions. It serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental physics and dynamics in a fun and engaging way.

## Features
- **Particle Creation:** Dynamically add particles to the simulation.
- **Gravity Control:** Adjust the gravitational force affecting the particles through a trackbar or numeric input.
- **Time Scaling:** Control the speed of the simulation with a dedicated trackbar.
- **Collision Detection:** Realistic particle collisions with energy conservation principles.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Smooth rendering using double buffering to eliminate flickering.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Introduction of different particle shapes, such as cubes.
  - Implementation of water physics for more complex interactions.
  - A menu screen for initializing the simulation with user-defined settings.
  - Addition of wind physics to influence particle motion.
  - Exploration of advanced physics concepts like torque and moment.
