### 1. Variable Particle Properties
- **Color by Age or Speed**: Particles change color dynamically based on their age or speed, adding a visual distinction as they move.
  - **Age**: Young particles appear blue, gradually shifting to red as they age.
  - **Speed**: Faster particles appear brighter to highlight high-velocity interactions.
- **Shape Variations**: Particles can be represented by different shapes (squares, triangles, or custom polygons), which users can select in settings to further enhance visual diversity.

### 2. Interactive Forces
- **Click-Gravity**: Apply a temporary gravitational force at a point clicked by the user, causing nearby particles to accelerate towards it.
- **Attractors and Repellers**: Add attraction or repulsion points in the field, controlled by distance, intensity, and type (gravity or anti-gravity).
- **Customizable Wind Patterns**: Switch from constant wind to periodic gusts or swirling patterns. Visualize the wind field with directional arrows in the background for a realistic environmental effect.

### 3. Realistic Physics Enhancements
- **Particle Decay**: Simulate decay by gradually reducing the particle count over time, as particles "evaporate" from the field.
- **Collisions and Bouncing**: Introduce advanced collision handling, including elasticity (bounciness) and friction for realistic particle-wall and particle-particle interactions.
- **Fluid or Gas Simulation**: Implement fluid dynamics for a liquid or gas effect, where particles interact according to principles of fluid mechanics.

### 4. Particle Trails and Persistence
- **Particle Trails**: Create comet-like trails behind moving particles. The trail length adjusts based on particle speed or lifetime, enhancing motion effects.
- **Particle Fading**: Particles gradually fade out instead of disappearing abruptly, simulating a natural lifecycle.

### 5. Dynamic Environment
- **Moving Boundaries**: Make the simulation boundaries draggable so users can reshape the particle field during runtime.
- **Obstacle Placement**: Allow users to place obstacles that particles avoid or bounce off, adding layers of interactivity.
- **Environment Conditions**: Choose from pre-set environments (e.g., space, underwater) that modify conditions like gravity and drag, all configurable in the `InitialSettingsForm`.

### 6. Control and Visualization Options
- **Real-Time Data Display**: Display real-time stats for particle properties like velocity, direction, and count in a status bar for comprehensive simulation feedback.
- **Visual Indicators for Forces**: Display arrows or heat maps to visualize forces at play (e.g., gravity, wind, attractors) for a more immersive experience.
- **User-Created Scenes**: Save and load specific scenes with pre-configured particle arrangements and settings, allowing comparisons and iterations across simulation sessions.

### 7. Particle Interaction Settings
- **Particle Merging**: Colliding particles merge into larger particles with combined mass and momentum, allowing growth and clustering effects.
- **Temperature and Fire Simulation**: Simulate temperature, where particles change behavior based on "temperature" â€” for example, particles can heat up or cool down, affecting color and motion.

### 8. Simulation Scenarios
- **Simulation Modes**: Activate specific modes such as:
  - **Fireworks**: Particles explode after a set duration.
  - **Rain**: Particles fall from the top, simulating rain or snowfall.
- **Particle Types with Unique Behaviors**: Different particle types with distinct properties and behaviors, e.g., fast-accelerating particles or lightweight particles affected more by wind.
